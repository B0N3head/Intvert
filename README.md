Intvert
======
A joke "Trojan" written in Batch, made to be put on a usb and lauch silently

## "Payloads"
#### Working
* Launch diffrent payloads on diffrent dates 
* Opens random webpages from a list
* Forces volume to max
* Display's random popups (Textboxes)
* Forces the victim to listen to a .mp3 file
* Inverts colors on screen
* Zooms randomly (Using magnifier)
* Disables taskmgr (Through regedit)
* Disables desktop icons
* Sends keys (Can be changed)
* Reverses Left/Right Click
* Randomly swtches between light/dark theme
* Opens random exe's in sys32
* Batch bomb ( %0|%0 )
* Bluescreens the computer to force restart (A restart was to lame)

#### Canceled/Broken/Unused
* Moves everything from desktop/music/downloads/pictures into documents (Disabled) 
* Sets background to .jpg (Broken)
* Fills desktop/music/downloads/pictures with random folders (Disabled)
* Add popular sites to hosts file and set to localhost (Broken)

## Its Just A Prank
The script creates a .bat on the desktop that deletes all leftover payloads and resets all edited regedit strings.
To disable the user from stoping the "trojan" the desktop icons are diabled and taskmgr is disabled 

## Combining With mp3
Combining the bat and 3 mp3's isn't needed but is recomended as no music will play as the payloads start (It feels kinda holo/empty), if you want to combine them its easily done with Bat To Exe Converter v3.2, but find somthing better if you can, seriously.
### Steps:
1. Set the exe format to 32/64 bit Invisible
2. Import 3 .mp3 files into embed tab
3. Set Extract to (For embedded items) to Downloads
4. Set to request admin mode
5. Paste the contence of Main.bat into main window
6. Convert & Done

## Music Files
* 1.mp3 is the main mp3 that will play when started
* 2.mp3 is used after the seccond text file is lauched
* 3.mp4 is for the christmas payload

#### This shitty program was made in a day as a proof of concept and is poorly made in its current state, expect errors. More payloads and comments will be introduced as time goes on as to make it easier to understand and edit.
