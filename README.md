Intvert
======
A joke "Trojan" written in Batch made to be put in a usb or combined with a .mp3 into an exe

## "Payloads"
* Opens random webpages from a list
* Forces volume to max
* Display's random popups (Textboxes)
* Forces the victim to listen to a .mp3 file
* Inverts colors on screen
* Zooms randomly (Using magnifier)
* Disables taskmgr (Through regedit)
* Disables desktop icons
* Sets background to .jpg (Broken atm)
* Sends keys (Can be changed)
* Reverses Left/Right Click
* Randomly swtches between light/dark theme
* Opens random exe's in sys32
* 
* Bluescreens the computer to force restart (A restart was to lame)
Canceled
* Moves everything from desktop/music/downloads/pictures into documents (Disabled as it proved to be to anoying) 
* Add popular sites to hosts file and set to localhost (Blocks websites form loading)

## Its Just A Prank
The script creates a .bat on the desktop that deletes all leftover payloads and resets all edited regedit strings.
To disable the user from stoping the "trojan" the desktop icons are diabled and taskmgr is disabled 

## Combining Together
Combining the bat and mp3 is done with [Bat To Exe Converter v3.2](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/File-Management/Batch-To-Exe-Converter.shtml#download)
